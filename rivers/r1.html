Ganga River is the most sacred river in Hindu religion. Ganga has been a symbol of divinity, spirituality, purity and moksha. Swami Vivekananda said, “Paris is the fountain-head of European civilization, as Gomukh is of the Ganga. Ganga finds mention in numerous ancient texts; she is a mother, a goddess, a life-giving river and a repository of people’s beliefs.
<br/>
In Northern India, it is a major river on whose banks civilizations have been established since time immemorial. The mighty river embarks on its 2,525 km (approx.) journey from the Garhwal Himalayas, Uttarakhand. Merging and gushing from one area to another, the river ultimately drains into the Bay of Bengal. The life-giving river passes through Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal before meeting the sea in Bangladesh.
<br/>
There are many streams which come together to form Ganga. Bhagirathi and Alaknanda are two of the most famous tributaries of Ganga.

Yamuna originates from Yamunotri glacier which lies at the height of 6,315 metres. The glacier is situated against a steep slope, a little below the Peak of Kalind Parbat (mountain) in Uttarakhand. Meltwater of Yamunotri glacier gathers at Saptarishi Kund from where the downward travel of the river commences. Her
reference as a river and as a goddess has been found in the various historical and ancient texts.
