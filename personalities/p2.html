The 4 Garhwal Rifles was awarded battle honour Nuranang, the only battle honour awarded to any Army unit in the Sino-Indian war of 1962. He was born on 19 August, 1941 to Shri Guman Singh Rawat, at village Baryun, Pauri Garhwal district, Uttarakhand. The orders for the 4 Garhwal rifles were to retreat from their position but Rifleman Jaswant Singh, remained at his post and repulsed Chinese troops for three days from overrunning the post. According to the legend he killed more than 150 Chinese Soldiers in the battle and the Chinese were so angry with him that they cut off his head back to China. After the ceasefire impressed by the soldier’s bravery, the Chinese returned the head along with a brass bust of Jaswant Singh. The exemplary bravery shown by Jaswant Rawat was honored by building a memorial at the post where he fought the Chinese army. The post which he held against the Chinese Army was named as Jaswant Garh. Another honor bestowed upon him is that
he continues in the service even after death, he has been awarded promotions as if he is still serving the Nation. Local people around Tawang area believe that he has become a saint and his spirit protects the area. The Indian army keeps at least half-a-dozen personnel here to take care of Rawat as if he is alive. He is served bed tea at 4.30 am, breakfast at 9 am and dinner at 7pm. Jaswant Rawat has been elevated by locals to a Holy Baba, who keeps vigil over the area and protects the region. A shrine, a memorial has been made at the place where he fought and the place is fondly called as Jaswant Garh. All Indian
Army personnel passing by this route from General to a Jawan pay their respects here. Jaswant is treated as if he is alive, his boots shined, linen washed, towels changed. Soldiers who polish his shoes claim that they are often found covered with mud, a sign that he has been walking around at night. The Legend goes that convoys in blizzards have seen Jaswant directing the vehicles through the serpentine bends. He continues to receive his promotions on time even after his death. He even gets letters from people seeking his blessings and help in all types of problems.
