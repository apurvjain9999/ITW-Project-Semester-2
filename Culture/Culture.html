Religion is big business in Uttarakhand, not just because it''s one of the important attractions for domestic tourists, but also because it''s a vital part of daily life for the people of these hills. Large segment of the people in Uttarakhand, especially in the upper reaches, are heterodox Buddhists and Hindus. This is the area which has been known as `Dev Bhoomi''- the land of the gods. Many of Hinduism''s most important shrines lie within Uttarakhand, tucked away in the mountains and along the rivers of the state. Amongst these, the most sacred are the `Char Dham''- the four shrines of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath, a pilgrimage of which is supposed to ensure instant salvation. The sacred Ganga, on its foaming path down to the plains, meets its tributaries at what are called the Panch Prayag- the five sacred `sangams'' of the river at Vishnuprayag, Nandprayag, Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag and Devprayag. And that''s not all; Hardwar and Rishikesh are two of Hinduism''s most prominent destinations for pilgrims, while the historical Gurudwara of Hemkund Sahib, near the Valley of Flowers, is an important shrine for Sikh.
