The Constitution of India also empowers the governor to act upon his or her own discretion, such as the ability to appoint or dismiss a ministry, recommend President's rule, or reserve bills for the President's assent. The governor of Uttarakhand has his official residence at the Raj Bhavan in the state capital
of Dehradun. Six people have served as the state's governor, five are men including one woman Margaret Alva who became the 1st female governor of Uttarakhand in 2009.
