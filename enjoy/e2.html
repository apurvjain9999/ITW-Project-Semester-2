Sahastradhara is a sulfur water spring of very low temperature and remarkable medicinal value. The aesthetic beauty of the site is exaggerated by the Baldi River and the caves. It lies at a distance of 14 kms from the Dehradun bus stand. There are buses regularly visiting the places from the city as well as the private taxis. Sahastradhara is suitable as a picnic spot.

<p>
The literal meaning of Sahastradhara is 'thousand fold spring'. Its immense beauty attracts people from far and away. It is said that whenever you go there you are sure to forget all your worries and sorrows. It is a place which rejuvenates our mind and makes us alive!

The place can be visited throughout the year. Nice luxurious accommodations are available at Sahastradhara. Some of them provide you with cabins with four beds each. There is absolutely no problem regarding accessibility. Dehradun is the nearest railhead.
