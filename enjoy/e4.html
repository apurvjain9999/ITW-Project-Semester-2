Kempty Falls is a magnificent waterfall and recreation area set in the lap of a green valley. It’s a favorite hangout of local residents, who come to cool off in waterholes, have fun with relaxed boating activities and enjoy scenic picnics. A British officer established Kempty Falls in the 1830s as a place for the British Raj to hold tea parties. The waterfall’s name is rumored to stem from the colloquial name of Camp Tea.

Follow the walkways and bridges that lead from the falls’ entrance to vantage points. Marvel as the milky-white water cascades down a cliff face before bouncing off rocks and into a manmade waterhole. Admire the verdant foliage that frames both sides of the waterfall. Listen to the invigorating sounds of the rushing water, which mingles with the excited cheering of visitors.

On a warm and sunny day you might want to take a refreshing dip in the inviting pool. Inflatable rings are available to rent and present the chance to float lazily on the shallow water. Stand directly beneath one of the branches of the falls to experience its full force. Around the pool, find restaurants serving traditional Indian snacks and a handful of shops selling curios.
